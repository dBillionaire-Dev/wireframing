# Wireframing

## 📌 What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is a low-fidelity visual representation of a user interface that outlines the structure and layout of a page or screen. It serves as a blueprint that focuses on content placement, user interactions, and navigation flow—without the distraction of colors, styles, or graphics.

Wireframes are usually created using tools like Figma, Balsamiq, Adobe XD, or even paper sketches, and can range from simple boxes and labels to more detailed interactive prototypes.

## 🎯 Why is Wireframing Important?

Wireframing plays a critical role in the **User Interface (UI)** and **User Experience (UX)** design process for several reasons:

- **Clarifies Structure and Flow**  
  Helps designers and developers understand how information and components will be organized.

- **Encourages Early Feedback**  
  Stakeholders can give input early in the design process before time is spent on high-fidelity design or development.

- **Saves Time and Resources**  
  Catching structural or usability issues early avoids costly rework later in development.

- **Improves Collaboration**  
  Provides a common visual language for designers, developers, and clients to align on expectations.

- **Focuses on Functionality**  
  Keeps the team focused on solving usability problems before investing in visual details.

## 📐 When to Use Wireframes

Wireframes are typically used in the **planning and analysis phase** of the design and development lifecycle. They are most effective when:

- Starting a new app or website
- Redesigning an existing interface
- Planning user flows or dashboards
- Testing layout ideas before final design
